# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project is a machine learning pipeline for classifying iris flower species based on their sepal and petal dimensions using the famous Iris dataset.

---

## 📜 Overview

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most widely used datasets in the machine learning community. It consists of **150 samples**, each with the following four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The objective is to classify the samples into one of **three species**:

- *Iris-setosa*
- *Iris-versicolor*
- *Iris-virginica*

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing:
- Renamed complex column names for better readability.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### 🧠 Model Building:
- Built classification models using supervised learning techniques.

### 📊 Visualizations:
- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful data plots.
