# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a **machine learning pipeline** for classifying iris flower species based on their sepal and petal dimensions using the Iris dataset.

## 📜 Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the machine learning community. It consists of 150 samples, each with four features:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The objective is to classify the samples into three species:
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Renamed complex column names for better readability.
  - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

- **Model Building**: 
  - Implemented machine learning models to classify the Iris species.

- **Visualizations**: 
  - Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create plots for better data understanding.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris dataset**. It is already included in the repository as `Iris.csv`.

## 🛠️ Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:
